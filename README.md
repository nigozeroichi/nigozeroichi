- Hi, I’m @nigozeroichi, or Horu Rodrigues-Chedid
- I’m interested in philosophy, art and science, in general. Generative art, complex system, data engineer and analysis (throw the hole data lifespan).
- I’m currently learning Databricks, NoSQL databases, database design, Azure DevOps (and other Azure's features), pipeline creation, Python (and PySpark) and SQL (MySQL, SparkSQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server)
- I’m looking to collaborate on social data science and analyses, creaning and trasnforming data and the intersection between art and technology (like the Rizhomatics)
- How to reach me: socialnetworks@horunigozeroichi.anonaddy.me
