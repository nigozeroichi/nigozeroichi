- 👋 Hi, I’m @nigozeroichi
- 👀 I’m interested in philosophy, art and science, in general. Generative art, complex system, data analyses (throw the hole data lifespan).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Databricks, Python and SQL (MySQL and SQL Server)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on social data analyses, creaning and trasnforming data and the intersection between art and technology (like the Rizhomatics)
